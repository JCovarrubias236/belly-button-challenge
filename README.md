# belly-button-challenge
This repository will be used for the module 14 challenge.

### Description

This project is my attempt to create an interactive dashboard to explore the belly button biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize the human belly button. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

For the interactive dashboard, I used JavaScript to create the plots, drop-down menu, and text box. I also implemented HTML to create the web page visualizing the JavaScript code. Please take a look at the link attached to the main screen of this repository to display the webpage hosted by GitHub Pages.

### Contribution

Feel free to take a look at the code and suggest any changes/improvements. I am still working on the gauge plot as seen in the app.js file.

As for the rest of the project, I heavily utilized many stack overflow forums and my boot camps ai tool to help me code the optionChanged function. This function is used to update all the plots to the user-selected id within the dropdown menu.
